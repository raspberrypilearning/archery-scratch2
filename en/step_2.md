## Aiming arrows

Let's start by creating an arrow that moves around the screen.

--- task ---
Open the Scratch [starter project](http://rpf.io/p/en/archery-scratch2-go){:target="_blank"} in the offline editor.

If you need to download and install the Scratch offline editor, you can find it at [rpf.io/scratchoff](http://rpf.io/scratchoff){:target="_blank"}.

In the starter project, you should see a target backdrop and a cross hair sprite.

When your game starts, broadcast a message to shoot a new arrow.

```blocks
when green flag clicked
broadcast [new arrow v]
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Once this message has been received, set the arrow's position and size.

```blocks
when I receive [new arrow v]
go to x: (-150) y: (-150)
set size to (400) %
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click the green flag to test your game. You should see your arrow get bigger and move to the bottom-left of the stage.

Add code to your arrow so that it `glides`{:class="blockmotion"} randomly around the stage `forever`{:class="blockcontrol"}.

```blocks
when I receive [new arrow v]
go to x: (-150) y: (-150)
set size to (400) %
+forever
glide (0.5) secs to x: (pick random (-150) to (150)) y: (pick random (-150) to (150))
end
```

Test your game again, and you should see your arrow move randomly around the stage.
