## Shooting arrows

Let's code your arrow to shoot when the space bar is pressed.

--- task ---

Stop the other script (the one moving the arrow) when the space bar is pressed.

```blocks
when [space v] key pressed
stop [other scripts in sprite v]
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Test your project again. This time, your arrow should stop moving __when the space bar is pressed__.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Animate your arrow, so that it looks like it's moving towards the target.

![target sprite](images/target-sprite.png)

```blocks
when [space v] key pressed
stop [other scripts in sprite v]
+repeat (50)
change size by (-10)
end
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Test your game again. This time, when you press the space bar you should see your arrow get smaller, as if it's moving towards the target.

Once your arrow is at the target, you can tell the player how many points they have scored. For example, they could score 200 points for hitting the yellow.

![target sprite](images/target-sprite.png)

```blocks
when [space v] key pressed
stop [other scripts in sprite v]
repeat (50)
change size by (-10)
end
+if <touching color (#ffff00) ?> then
say [200 points] for (2) secs
end
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

You can also play a sound if they hit the yellow.

![target sprite](images/target-sprite.png)

```blocks
when [space v] key pressed
stop [other scripts in sprite v]
repeat (50)
change size by (-10)
end
if <touching color (#ffff00) ?> then
+play sound [cheer v]
say [200 points] for (2) secs
end
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Finally, you need to broadcast the `new arrow`{:class="blockevents"} message again to get a new arrow.

![target sprite](images/target-sprite.png)

```blocks
when [space v] key pressed
stop [other scripts in sprite v]
repeat (50)
change size by (-10)
end
if <touching color (#ffff00) ?> then
play sound [cheer v]
say [200 points] for (2) secs
end
+broadcast [new arrow v]
```
--- /task ---
